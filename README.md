# How to use
## Download release.zip and extract it to its own folder!
I would name it something like testwebsite
## Add a file you want in the in the testwebsite/public/ dir and you can run the executable
doing this will start the webserver and will tell you what port it is running on
## You can edit the 404.html to add a custom 404 page
